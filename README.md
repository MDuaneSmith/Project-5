# project5-MDuaneSmith

## Approach

I started out this project by going back and looking through the code I wrote for Project 1 and calculating the hamming distance.
I recycled some of that code for calculating and formatted it to be useful with this project. Then I started making all the private variables
that I thought I would need. Following this I moved onto just making each of the JPanels and the buttons and different JPanel related
things. I would go back after I finished formatting everything to apply the code to make the buttons and sliders to do things.
Once done formatting I began writing the methods to make the buttons calculate the corresponding things. Once finished I then went
to work on the free space part. I wanted to embed the Wikipedia page for Hamming Distance into the page and first tried to do it
a different way but it would not work. So I used google and zybooks to learn about JFXPanels and using WebView to put the article 
into the GUI. Once I was satisfied with the webpage working, I went back and did all the documentation for everything.
